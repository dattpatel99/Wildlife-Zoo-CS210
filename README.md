# Cplusplus-Program

The project was about importing data from a file called 'zoodata.txt' and adding data into a vector which user can add, and remove elements from. Then the user can overwrtie the zoodata file and save the data in the vector to the same file. This project was to show how to intergrate two languages: C++ and Java.

I think I setup the class structure well and handled the pointers well, so that there would be no memory leak.

I think my code could be made better in areas like handling the vector or sotring the data in the file. I think that there are better ways to handle the vector then what I have done.

I found it difficult to write the code for the vector of type pointer. It was my first time actually using poitners so I very little idea as to how they would work, also I was pretty unclear in how to use pointers in general. I overcame this with trial and error. Another difficulty I had was with erasing an element from the vector. Usually it is very easy to do in Java or Python but in C++ i had to use an iterator to erase the element. I had no idea what an iterator was and how they work but I looked it up and found a few links to some stakcoverflow replies which really helped in understanding how to use the iterator.

The best skills from this project that I can transfer are usage of vectors and pointers. The rest of the stuck was relatively easy and not too difficult.

This code is maintainable, readable, and adaptable becasue I have used a good class structure that anyone can easily understand. Also, I have used a lot of comments that would help the programmer understand what is written there and how it works making it easy to adapt and read the code. Finally, I have used funcitons where possbile so that if a programmer wants to chagne a certain working of the code all he/she has to do is find that function and edit it.
